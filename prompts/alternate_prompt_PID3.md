You are performing a high-fidelity product image compositing task. Use Image 1 as the Base Image defining the exact product geometry, proportions, orientation, structure, and identity, which must not be altered, redesigned, or reinterpreted in any way. Use Image 2 as the Background Reference defining the target environment; the background itself must remain intact and unmodified, with no warping or content changes, and only the product’s placement, scale, perspective alignment, and exposure integration may be adjusted to fit naturally within it. Images 3+ (if provided) are material reference images used solely to match correct material behavior such as transparency, reflectivity, refraction, edge behavior, and surface response, and must never be used to infer or modify product geometry.

Precisely extract the entire product from Image 1 and place it into the background from Image 2 so that the full product is visible and fully contained within the output frame. The product must retain exact proportions, silhouette, and structure from Image 1, must be visually centered and vertically aligned unless clearly incompatible with the background perspective, and must not have any components added, removed, or repositioned. Do not add cast or contact shadows onto the background; preserve only self-shadowing intrinsic to the product as seen in Image 1. Match material transparency and surface qualities to the reference images without exaggeration or reduction. Ensure clean integration with no halos, cutout edges, warping, scale inconsistencies, or duplicated elements. Do not redesign, stylize, or artistically interpret any aspect.

Output a single final image at the same aspect ratio as Image 1. If upscaling is applied, limit it to a maximum of 2× per dimension (approximately 4× total pixels). As the final step, enhance the perceived detail of existing textures by subtly increasing local contrast, clarity, and fine tonal separation without changing resolution, resizing, or inventing detail. Emphasize only texture that already exists, avoid oversharpening, noise amplification, or artificial patterns, and maintain original lighting direction, color balance, highlights, and product self-shadows. The result must be photorealistic, clean, and catalog-ready for professional e-commerce use.
