Task: High-fidelity e-commerce product synthesis and relighting.

Core Subject: * Source Product: Extract the chandelier from Image 1. Maintain its exact 1:1 structural geometry, component placement, and physical proportions.

Placement: Position the chandelier in the environment of Image 2, centered and vertically aligned precisely as it appears in its original frame. Do not scale, tilt, or modify its silhouette.

Environment & Integration:

Background: Use the room/setting from Image 2 as the static background.

Global Illumination: The chandelier from Image 1 must act as the primary light source for the scene. Relight the background of Image 2 to match the light temperature, intensity, and glow of the new chandelier.

Physically-Based Rendering (PBR): Apply material properties from Image 3 to the product. Render realistic light refraction through glass elements and specular highlights on metallic surfaces.

Reflections: Ensure the metallic and glass surfaces of the chandelier accurately reflect the colors and environment of the background in Image 2.

Technical Constraints:

Seamless Blend: Zero haloing, no visible cutout edges, and perfect alpha-channel integration.

Resolution: Generate at 4K resolution with ultra-high clarity and sharp focus.

Style: Clean, professional e-commerce catalog aesthetic. Photorealistic, 35mm lens quality, neutral and balanced color grading.

Technical Quality: 

Resolution: Generate at 4K resolution.

Clarity: 8.0 megapixel equivalent or higher, ultra-sharp focus, and zero compression artifacts.

Aspect Ratio: Match the exact aspect ratio of Image 1.

Final Processing:

Perform a high-resolution pass to enhance fine details (crystals, wires, textures) while strictly preserving the original design and material integrity of the product.
